# City Queue - University assignment

Implementation of a city queue using the C++ programming language.

## Description

The queue consists of cities with some information such as name, number of inhabitants, code, distance to the previous city, and distance to the next city. Each city has a pointer that points to the previous city and a pointer that points to the next city.

The initially created city is Florianópolis, and the program allows creating cities to the right (Tubarão and Criciúma) and to the left (Blumenau and Joinville).

The program also allows displaying all cities in the queue, as well as removing the city from the head or tail of the queue.
